# Pokémaze
Pokémaze, a game made using C for the Game Boy Advance

## Overview
Play as Pikachu, and escape with the green gem from the evil Gyarados.

## Instructions
The START button is mapped to the Enter Key.
The SELECT button is mapped to the Backspace Key.
The arrow keys map to the regular arrow keys.

Simply use the arrow keys to move Pikachu from the left of the screen to the right.
Avoid getting hit by the enemies. 
The goal is to touch the green gem without getting hit.

There is a score at the top. It reduces roughly every 3-4 moves you make. 
This adds another restriction onto how you must move from start to finish.

If you either get hit by a single enemy or your score hits 0, you instantly lose.
